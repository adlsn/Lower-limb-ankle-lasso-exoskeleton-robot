---
* ## Approval department: National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)
* ## Project Requirement: Research on an exoskeleton robot that helps patients with lower limb disorders to walk Normally. 
* ## My responsibility: Design robotic structure, manufacture prototypes, test performance, design control algorithms.
* ## Problems & Solutions: The motion control accuracy of the lasso is low. Design an adaptive gait trajectory method with multi-source sensing fusion, improving the control precision.
* ##Gains: Learn about motion control principles, C++, sensor design, multi-source information processing, robot modeling and design methods. Obtain the 3rd prize in the National Graduate Robotics Competition.
